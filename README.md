# Shopify Backend Challenge

Greetings,

My name is Deep Patel and this is the repository for my submission for the Shopify backend developer intern for summer 2022 challenge.

I originally envisoned of creating a basic front end using React however due to time constraints and issues with creating a ASP.NET framework with React project, I was unable to properly finish the front end. Therefore, the current version of the repository contains finished backend endpoints and only missing frontend.
