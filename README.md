# Shopify Backend Challenge

Greetings,

My name is Deep Patel and this is the repository for my submission for the Shopify backend developer intern for summer 2022 challenge.

I originally envisoned of creating a basic front end using React however due to time constraints and issues with creating a ASP.NET framework with React project, I was unable to properly finish the front end. Therefore, the current version of the repository contains finished backend endpoints and only missing frontend.

This project was created using C# and SQLite database using ASP.NET framework for the back-end. It contains CRUD features as well as allowing specific inventory to be added or removed from a collection. The project contains industry standard code which features error detection, input validation, and specific error codes to provide further information on which type of error has occured. Although the front-end does not currently work, it was implemented using React to allow a basic user interface to navigate to different pages for specific functions.
